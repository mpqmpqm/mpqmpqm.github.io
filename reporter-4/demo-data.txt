# Start with a 50/50 shot good or bad
# Once inside a day, then roll for predominant buttons. Buttons that correspond to day roll are favored.
# Really only need five clicks

For each day doc:
1. Roll for good day or bad day
  2. if good day, then highest chances for kiss, warm, laugh, lower chance for question, thumbs-down
    3. Roll five times:
      if (Math.random () <= .7) {
        click day-predominant button
      }
      else {
        click non-day-predominant button
      }
  return roll

Roll again. Previous roll is favored, unless streak:
  if (Math.random () < .7) roll equals previous roll
    if (Math.random () > .streakCount) plus streakCount
    

  else roll, streakCount = 1
