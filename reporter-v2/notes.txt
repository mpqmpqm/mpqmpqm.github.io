- Last 14 days, last 30 days, last 90 days
- five-line line charts: x-axis is day, y-axis is percentage total reports
- maybe add new firestore document for each new day?
    - No, that's stupid, but maybe, nest reports one level? e.g. 
        const reports = {
            [new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10)]: [
                {
                    mood: x,
                    timestamp: y
                },
                {
                    mood: x,
                    timestamp: z
                }
            ],
            [new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10)]: [
                {
                    mood: x,
                    timestamp: y
                },
                {
                    mood: x,
                    timestamp: z
                }
            ]
}

Or maybe it's best to keep everything in a heap? Will likely depend on what I'm capable of executing ðŸ˜œ 

- Date.getMonth()
- Date.getDate() // day of the month
- Date.getDay() //day of the week
- Date.toJSON().slice(0,10) //e.g. '2020-01-03'

const reports = {
    [new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10)]: {
        kisses: [timestamp, timestamp],
        laughs: [timestamp, timestamp]
    },
    [new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10)]: {
        kisses: [timestamp, timestamp],
        laughs: [timestamp, timestamp]
    }
}

const reports = [
    {

    }

]

//need to be able to handle a day without submissions...! We could handle that while parsing previous days

Each VictoryLine takes its own data

Line chart and polar chart data structures have to be totally different... 

For polar charts we are plotting emoji (x) against count (y)

For line charts, each line is an emoji. So we are plotting date (x) against percentage total (y)

Sample data object from firestore:

reports: [
  {
    "1/3/2020": {
      "kisses": [
        1,
        2,
        3
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "1/4/2020": {
      "kisses": [
        1,
        2,
        3
      ]
    }
  }
]


setState(reports => {
    return (
        reports: firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion ({today: {
            kisses: firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion (timestamp)
        }})
})
